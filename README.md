# Sweet Shop Project

A simple **Sweet Shop application written in C++** that simulates basic shop operations such as viewing available sweets, placing orders, and calculating the total bill. This project was created for learning and practice purposes, focusing on core C++ concepts and clean program structure.

---

##  Project Overview

The Sweet Shop project allows a user to:

* View a list of available sweets
* Select sweets and quantities
* Calculate the total bill
* Exit the program gracefully

This project demonstrates the use of **loops, conditional statements, functions, and basic data handling in C++**.

##  My AI Usage

### AI Tools Used

* **Replit AI**

### How I Used AI

* I used **Replit AI** to:

  * Improve code readability and structure
  * Get suggestions for optimizing logic
  * Generate and refine README documentation
  * Understand best practices for writing clean C++ code

### Reflection on AI Usage

Using Replit AI helped me **work faster and more efficiently** by providing instant feedback and suggestions. It improved my understanding of code structure and documentation standards. I ensured that I **reviewed and understood every AI-generated suggestion** before applying it, using AI as a learning aid rather than a replacement for my own thinking.

I believe AI is a powerful productivity tool when used responsibly, and this project reflects my ability to leverage AI effectively while maintaining full ownership of the code and logic.
