TDD Kata: Sweet Shop Management SystemObjectiveThe goal of this kata is to design, build, and test a full-stack Sweet Shop ManagementSystem. This project will test your skills in API development, database management,frontend implementation, testing, and modern development workflows, including the useof AI tools.Core Requirements1. Backend API (RESTful)You are to build a robust backend API that will serve as the brain of the application.• Technology: Choose one of the following: Node.js/TypeScript (withExpress/NestJS), Python (with Django/FastAPI), Java (with Spring Boot), or Ruby(with Rails).• Database: The application must connect to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL,MongoDB, SQLite). An in-memory database is not sufficient.• User Authentication:o Users must be able to register and log in.o Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to secure certain APIendpoints.• API Endpoints:o Auth: POST /api/auth/register, POST /api/auth/logino Sweets (Protected):▪ POST /api/sweets: Add a new sweet.▪ GET /api/sweets: View a list of all available sweets.▪ GET /api/sweets/search: Search for sweets by name, category, or pricerange.▪ PUT /api/sweets/:id: Update a sweet's details.▪ DELETE /api/sweets/:id: Delete a sweet (Admin only).o Inventory (Protected):▪ POST /api/sweets/:id/purchase: Purchase a sweet, decreasing itsquantity.▪ POST /api/sweets/:id/restock: Restock a sweet, increasing its quantity(Admin only).Each sweet must have a unique ID, name, category, price, and quantity in stock.
2. Frontend ApplicationYou must build a modern, single-page application (SPA) to interact with your backend API.• Technology: You must use a modern frontend framework like React, Vue, Angular,or Svelte.• Functionality:o User registration and login forms.o A dashboard or homepage to display all available sweets.o Functionality to search and filter sweets.o A "Purchase" button on each sweet, which should be disabled if the quantityis zero.o (For Admin Users) Forms/UI to add, update, and delete sweets.• Design: This is a chance to show your creativity. The application should be visuallyappealing, responsive, and provide a great user experience.Process & Technical Guidelines1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)Write tests before implementing functionality. We expect to see a clear "Red-Green-Refactor" pattern in your commit history, especially for the backend logic. Aim for high testcoverage with meaningful test cases.2. Clean Coding PracticesWrite clean, readable, and maintainable code. Follow SOLID principles and other bestpractices in software design. Your code should be well-documented with meaningfulcomments and clear naming conventions.3. Git & Version ControlUse Git for version control. Commit your changes frequently with clear, descriptivemessages that narrate your development journey.4. AI Usage Policy (Important)We believe AI is a critical tool in the modern software development lifecycle. You areencouraged and expected to use AI tools. However, you must be transparent about it.• AI Co-authorship: For every commit where you used an AI tool (for generatingboilerplate, writing tests, debugging, etc.), you must add the AI as a co-author.
How to add a co-author: At the end of your commit message, add two empty lines,followed by the co-author trailer.git commit -m "feat: Implement user registration endpointUsed an AI assistant to generate the initial boilerplate for thecontroller and service, then manually added validation logic.Co-authored-by: AI Tool Name <AI@users.noreply.github.com>"• README Documentation: Your README.md file must include a detailed sectiontitled "My AI Usage". In this section, you must describe:o Which AI tools you used (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).o How you used them (e.g., "I used Gemini to brainstorm API endpointstructures," or "I asked Copilot to generate unit tests for my service layer").o Your reflection on how AI impacted your workflow.• Interview Discussion: Be prepared to discuss your AI usage in detail during theinterview. We are interested in how you leverage these tools effectively andresponsibly.Deliverables1. A public Git repository link (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab).2. A comprehensive README.md file that includes:a. A clear explanation of the project.b. Detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project locally (bothbackend and frontend).c. Screenshots of your final application in action.d. The mandatory "My AI Usage" section.3. A test report showing the results of your test suite.4. (Optional - Brownie Points) A link to the deployed, live application on a platformlike Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, or AWS.Note: Plagiarism is strictly forbidden. While we encourage AI assistance, submitting codecopied from other repositories or developers will result in immediate rejection. We want tosee your work, augmented by modern tools
